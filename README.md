Habit Failure Log
Overview
The Habit Failure Log is a structured system designed to record, analyse, and understand instances where planned habits are not completed successfully. It helps users reflect on failures, identify patterns, and improve long-term habit consistency.
________________________________________
Problem Addressed
Failure to maintain habits without proper reflection can lead to repeated mistakes, low motivation, and poor self-discipline. This log provides a systematic approach to documenting habit failures, analysing root causes, and applying corrective actions for improvement.
________________________________________
Main Features
• Record Habit Failures – Logs details of missed or incorrectly performed habits.
• Failure Analysis – Identifies reasons, triggers, and conditions leading to failure.
• Self-Reflection – Encourages users to analyse what went wrong.
• Corrective Actions – Helps plan improvements for future attempts.
• Learning Tracking – Records lessons learned from each failure.
• Structured Logging – Maintains consistency in habit evaluation.

Data Fields Used
• Date – Records the date of habit failure.
• Day – Specifies the day of the week.
• Habit Name – Name of the habit being tracked.
• Planned Action – Intended task or behaviour.
• Planned Time / Frequency – Scheduled time or repetition pattern.
• Status / Outcome – Missed, Partially Done, or Done Incorrectly.
• Reason for Failure – Primary cause of failure.
• Trigger / Cause – Situation or event leading to failure.
• Location – Place where the failure occurred.
• Mood / Mental State – Emotional condition at the time.
• Failure Description – Explanation of what went wrong.
• Corrective Action – Immediate step to avoid repetition.
• Lesson Learned – Key takeaway from the failure.
• Preventive Measure – Long-term strategy for improvement.

Python Concepts Used
Data Structures
•	Dictionary – Stores task information using task attributes as keys.
•	Lists – Stores multiple task records.
•	Dictionary of Lists Structure – Each list index represents one complete task record.
•	Efficient Data Management – Enables easy addition, viewing, and updating of tasks.
Control Flow
•	While Loop – Keeps the program running until exit.
•	If / Elif / Else Statements – Handles menu selection logic.
•	For Loop – Iterates through task records for display and search operations.
Functions
•	show_menu() – Displays available menu options.
•	add_task() – Collects and stores weekly task details.
•	view_tasks() – Displays all tasks.
•	update_task_status() – Updates task progress.
•	search_task() – Searches the task using the Task ID.
•	save_to_file() – Saves task data to a file.
•	load_from_file() – Loads task data when the program starts.
•	exit_program() – Saves data and exits safely.
Methods
List Methods
•	append() – Adds new task records.
•	len() – Determines the total number of tasks.
Dictionary Methods
•	keys() – Accesses dictionary keys.
•	values() – Accesses dictionary values.
•	get() – Safely retrieves task information.
String Methods
•	strip() – Removes unnecessary spaces from input.
•	title() – Formats task details properly.
Exception Handling
•	try / except Block – Handles invalid input errors.
•	ValueError Handling – Prevents crashes due to wrong data types.
•	User-Friendly Messages – Displays clear error messages.
•	Smooth Program Execution – Ensures uninterrupted execution.
File Handling and Libraries
•	File Handling – Task data is saved and loaded using file handling.
•	Read and Write Operations – Files opened in read ("r") and write ("w") modes.
•	Data Persistence – Task details are not lost after program termination.
•	Libraries Used – Only standard Python libraries are used.
How to Run
1.	Open Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
2.	Run the weekly task tracker program file.
3.	Execute the main program.
4.	Follow on-screen menu instructions.
Input and Usage Guidelines
•	Numeric Inputs – Task ID must be numeric.
•	Text Inputs – Task name, description, and remarks are text-based.
•	Menu Selection – Choose options using menu numbers.
•	Invalid Input Handling – Error messages displayed for wrong inputs.
•	Exit Procedure – Use the exit option to save tasks safely.
File and Dataset Details
•	Data File Name – Task data stored in weekly_task_tracker.txt.
•	File Location – Stored in the same folder as the Python program.
•	Stored Fields – Task ID, Task Name, Description, Priority, Status, Start Date, End Date, and Remarks.
•	File Creation – File created automatically if not present.
•	Data Loading – Task data loads at program start.

Testing and Screenshots
Useful test scenarios:
•	Adding a task
 

•	Viewing all tasks
 

 
•	Updating task status
 
•	Searching task by Task ID
 

Assignment Fit and Extras
•	Meets Assignment Requirements – Suitable for Python mini-project.
•	Real-World Application – Useful for students and professionals.
•	Structured Programming – Uses functions, loops, and conditions.
•	Error Handling – Includes exception handling.
•	Data Persistence – Implements file handling.
•	Easy to Extend – Can be enhanced with reports and analytics.
